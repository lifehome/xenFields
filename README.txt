UPGRADING
---------

To upgrade an existing add-on, you will need to extract the zip and upload all
files within the upload directory to your existing XenForo Directory,
overwriting all files.

Once the files are uploaded, your XenForo installation will automatically be
closed until the upgrade is complete. To begin the upgrade, log in to the Admin
Control Panel, where you will see a notice indicating that there are new
add-ons ready to be upgraded. Click the notice to upgrade your add-on.

Once the upgrade is complete, your XenForo installation will automatically be
reopened.

Note: the notice will not appear if you are upgrading to a fourth-point (x.x.xX)
version of the same release (i.e., from 1.1.2 to 1.1.2b) as upgrading the
database is not required.
